Text-based video game written in Java

Text-Based video game inspired in the Nintendo's saga Phoenix Wright.
In the Video, you are a attourney, and the objective of the game is to win the case in the court.
Read all the information given in the game, look at the evidence provided and use your intuition to win the case.

You lose the game if you make 5 wrong movements in court and therefore you lose the case.

This was a group project.
